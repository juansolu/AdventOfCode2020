# Problem workspace details

Each day's problem is broken up into a specific folder. There can be multiple questions per day so each problem is labeled as 1, 2, 3 etc for the problem number with more specific details related to problem in the day folder's README.md file.

Usually first attempt is a working solution usually through a brute force method and further attempts to optimize space or time trade offs can be found in 1_2..., 1_3.. files.

Analysis on the subsequent attempts to improve solution are further analyzed in an optimization.py file taking into account execution time and readability/maintainability considerations.
